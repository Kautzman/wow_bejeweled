This project is being archived in the near future. As I have moved onto other things and don't really have the time or effort in maintaining it. 

I highly recommend those looking for continued support (as of Dragonflight) to head over to Kautzman's fork. Located here. 
https://github.com/Kautzman/wow_bejeweled/


Bejeweled has returned to Azeroth! A game made by PopCap Games, Inc.

Just download the zip and place the "Bejeweled" folder into the /Interface/AddOns/ folder.

Please use a bug reporting addon before opening issues.

Any help getting this addon working 100% is welcome.
